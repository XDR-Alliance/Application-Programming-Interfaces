# Application-Programming-Interfaces

Welcome to the Exabeam and [XDR Alliance Application](https://www.xdralliance.com/) Programming Interface (API) Specifications. 

The Application Programming Interface Specifications defines the available RESTful API endpoints, expected body parameters, and responses for APIs to Exabeam. With the API endpoints, organizations can programmatically interact with Exabeam (as headless SaaS) to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of their SOC organization. 

The API specifications are in an [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) 3.x [YAML Ain't Markup Language (YAML)](https://yaml.org/) format. The specifications can be imported into your API client, catalog, or Integrated Development Environment. 

The open-source API specifications are also available on [Exabeamâ€™s Developer Portal](https://developers.exabeam.com/). The portal functions as an interactive development hub where you can learn about and interact with the open-source APIs. The easy-to-navigate design lets you browse endpoints for multiple applications, see the body parameters, and expected responses. For each endpoint, developers can plug in parameter values and autogenerate functioning code. For more advanced use cases, developers may read the guides, recipes, and engage in discussions with other developers in the community.
